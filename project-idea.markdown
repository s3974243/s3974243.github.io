RemNote is a note-taking, digital flashcard, and spaced repetition tool. It's main purpose is to aid in learning and studying. The aim of this project is to create a plugin for RemNote that allows its users to be read flashcards by text to speech software and for oral answers to then be processed by voice recognition software. Additionally, new flashcards and notes will be able to created by speaking.

RemNote's Frontend Plugin API allows a website to be embedded in RemNote.

To create this plugin, three main pieces of software are required. RemNote's API, a TTS software, and a voice recognition software. I will use <a href="https://github.com/marytts/marytts">Mary TTS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi">the Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit</a> for the latter two respectively. These are both open source and can function in web clients
Each user will have to have a capable computer equipped with both a microphone and speaker (or some other form of audio output).
